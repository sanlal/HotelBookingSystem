This project is a console-based hotel booking system developed using Python and MySQL Workbench. 
It simulates a basic hotel management system that allows users to book rooms, manage customer data, 
and handle check-in/check-out operations through a simple text-based interface.

# * Technologies Used
Programming Language: Python
Database: MySQL (via MySQL Workbench)
